# Resumable File Upload System

A focused Next.js application dedicated to demonstrating robust resumable file upload functionality with all the core requirements for large file handling.

## Project Focus

This application is specifically designed to showcase:
- **Resumable file uploads** with automatic and manual resume capabilities
- **Chunked upload processing** for files ranging from 5MB to 200GB
- **Session persistence** that survives browser restarts and navigation
- **Real-time progress tracking** with speed and time estimates
- **File integrity validation** using checksum verification
- **Robust error handling** with retry mechanisms

## Core Features

### üîÑ Resumable Upload Technology
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Resume**: Uploads continue after connection interruptions
- ‚úÖ **Manual Pause/Resume**: User-controlled upload management
- ‚úÖ **Browser Restart Recovery**: State persists across browser sessions
- ‚úÖ **Navigation Tolerance**: Background uploads during page navigation

### üìä Progress & Monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Progress**: Live progress bars with percentage completion
- ‚úÖ **Upload Statistics**: Track total, successful, and failed uploads
- ‚úÖ **Speed Indicators**: Real-time upload speed and ETA calculations
- ‚úÖ **Chunk-level Tracking**: Monitor individual chunk upload progress

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability & Integrity
- ‚úÖ **File Integrity**: SHA-256 checksum validation
- ‚úÖ **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ **Connection Resilience**: Handles network interruptions gracefully
- ‚úÖ **Large File Support**: Efficiently handles files up to 200GB

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
- ‚úÖ **Chunked Processing**: Files split into optimal chunks (5MB-100MB)
- ‚úÖ **Parallel Uploads**: Multiple chunks uploaded simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming approach for large files
- ‚úÖ **Background Processing**: Non-blocking upload operations

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React, TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand with localStorage persistence
- **File Upload**: AWS S3 SDK with multipart uploads
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **File Processing**: Crypto-JS for integrity validation
- **Development**: ESLint, PostCSS

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd upload-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` with your AWS S3 credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_BUCKET=uploader-name
   NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_REGION=eu-north-1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-access-key
   ```

4. **Configure S3 bucket** (see S3-SETUP.md for detailed instructions):
   - Set up CORS policy for web uploads
   - Configure IAM permissions for multipart uploads
   - Test bucket access

5. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)** in your browser.

## Usage

### Basic Upload
1. Navigate to the Upload page
2. Drag and drop a file or click to browse
3. Monitor real-time progress with speed and ETA
4. Files are automatically chunked and uploaded in parallel

### Resumable Uploads
- **Automatic Resume**: If connection is lost, uploads resume automatically when restored
- **Manual Pause**: Click the pause button to temporarily stop an upload
- **Manual Resume**: Click the resume button to continue a paused upload
- **Session Persistence**: Close the browser and uploads will resume when you return

### Navigation During Upload
- Upload progress is shown in the global indicator at the top
- Navigate between pages while uploads continue in the background
- Return to the Upload page to see detailed progress

## Configuration

### Upload Settings
- **Chunk Size**: Configurable from 5MB to 100MB (default: 5MB)
- **Concurrent Uploads**: 1-5 parallel chunks (default: 3)
- **Retry Attempts**: Number of retry attempts for failed chunks (default: 3)
- **File Size Limits**: 5MB minimum, 200GB maximum

### AWS S3 Setup
1. Create an S3 bucket with appropriate permissions
2. Enable CORS for web uploads:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
       "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT"],
       "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000"],
       "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
     }
   ]
   ```
3. Configure IAM user with S3 upload permissions

## API Endpoints
