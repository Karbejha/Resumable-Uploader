```

### Key Components

1. **UploadManager** (`services/uploadManager.ts`)
   - Orchestrates the entire upload process
   - Handles chunking, parallel uploads, and error recovery
   - Manages upload lifecycle and state updates

2. **S3UploadService** (`services/s3UploadService.ts`)
   - Direct integration with AWS S3 multipart upload API
   - Handles chunk uploading, completion, and cancellation
   - Provides retry logic and error handling

3. **Upload Store** (`store/uploadStore.ts`)
   - Centralized state management using Zustand
   - Persists upload state to localStorage
   - Provides actions for all upload operations

4. **File Upload Component** (`components/FileUpload.tsx`)
   - User interface for file selection and upload initiation
   - Drag & drop functionality
   - Upload history and management

5. **Upload Item Component** (`components/UploadItem.tsx`)
   - Individual upload progress display
   - Pause/resume/cancel controls
   - Real-time status updates

## üéØ Key Features Implementation

### Resumable Uploads
- Uses S3 multipart upload with `ListParts` API to check existing chunks
- Stores upload state in localStorage for browser restart recovery
- Automatically resumes on network reconnection

### Manual Controls
- Pause: Cancels active chunk uploads and updates state
- Resume: Checks for uploaded parts and continues from last chunk
- Cancel: Aborts S3 multipart upload and cleans up state

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time calculation of upload speed and remaining time
- Chunk-level progress tracking for accuracy
- Visual progress bars and percentage indicators

### Session Persistence
- Zustand store with localStorage persistence
- Upload state survives page refreshes and browser restarts
- Automatic restoration of upload sessions

### File Integrity
- SHA-256 checksum calculation before upload
- Post-upload validation (infrastructure ready)
- Chunk-level integrity with S3 ETags

### Background Uploads
- Global upload indicator shows progress across all pages
- Upload continues while navigating between application pages
- Non-blocking UI updates

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_REGION=us-east-1
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-access-key
```

### Upload Settings
- Chunk Size: 5MB - 100MB (optimized based on file size)
- Concurrent Uploads: 1-5 parallel chunks
- Retry Attempts: 3 with exponential backoff
- File Size Limits: 5MB minimum, 200GB maximum

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add your AWS S3 credentials

3. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open Browser**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Test upload functionality

## üìã Testing Scenarios
