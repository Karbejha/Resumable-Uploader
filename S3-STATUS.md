# S3 Integration Status

## ✅ Completed
- [x] **Environment Configuration**: S3 credentials added to `.env.local`
- [x] **Configuration Validation**: Added S3 config validation and error handling
- [x] **Real S3 Integration**: Application now uses your actual S3 bucket
- [x] **Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:3001
- [x] **Error Handling**: UI displays configuration issues if any

## 🔧 Your S3 Configuration
```
Bucket Name: uploader-name
Region: eu-north-1 (Stockholm)
Access Key: AKIAXW35EKTSZ2IAVRGH
Environment: Development
```

## 🚀 Next Steps Required

### 1. Configure S3 Bucket CORS (Required)
You need to add CORS policy to your S3 bucket. Go to:
- AWS S3 Console → uploader-name → Permissions → CORS
- Add the CORS configuration from `S3-SETUP.md`

### 2. Set IAM Permissions (Required)
Your IAM user needs multipart upload permissions:
- AWS IAM Console → Your User → Add Inline Policy
- Use the policy from `S3-SETUP.md`

### 3. Test the Integration
Once CORS and permissions are set:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/upload
2. Try uploading a file
3. Check your S3 bucket for the uploaded chunks

## 📝 Files Updated
- `.env.local` - Your S3 credentials
- `src/utils/s3Config.ts` - Configuration validation
- `src/components/FileUpload.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
- `S3-SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `README.md` - Updated with your configuration

## 🔍 Configuration Check
The application will automatically:
- Validate your S3 configuration on startup
- Display helpful error messages if something is missing
- Log configuration details in development mode

## ⚠️ Important Notes
1. **CORS Policy**: Without proper CORS, uploads will fail with CORS errors
2. **IAM Permissions**: Without multipart upload permissions, chunks will fail
3. **Security**: Your credentials are in `.env.local` (gitignored for security)

Your resumable file upload system is now ready for real S3 integration!
